In order to keep our project sane and usable for everyone we decided to set up
couple of rules on what is mandated in OBS submissions:

 * Packages should be link to respective released versions from OBS
 * All changes must be done in Devel (Tumbleweed) via submitrequests
 * Released products branches are handled with maintenance approach (like normal openSUSE release)
 * All project specific packages must have designated maintainer in them
 * No overwriting of system provided packages (brp check like in Backports)
 * Packages must adhere to [openSUSE packaging guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines)
