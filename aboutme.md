Aim
---

Our idea is to provide repository of various tools and packages (see the
Software section) that will enable our contributors and users to learn and use
the software stack to better themselves and their skills around the provided
packages.

In order to achieve that we also want the playground to be stable and reliable
even for people interested in just using the stack rather than contributing.

Or aim is to ensure stability and reliability by using [maintenance process](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Maintenance_update_process)
which will ensure stable codebase for users from the stable distributions,
while allowing us to play (and break) the stack in our Devel repository that will
be delivered to [openSUSE:Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed)

Software
--------

We have spend quite some time discussing ideas on what software stack we should
be able to contain in our project. In the end the basically we welcome all
contributions but our core focus is:

 * Links of packages from openSUSE to enable additional features
 * Multimedia applications
 * Cryptography packages
 * Sniffers
 * Penetration testing tools
 * ZFS on Linux
 * ...
